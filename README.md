## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aye7822/ayebel-joshy-frontend-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd wefo-studio-website
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

2. **Build for production:**

   To create an optimized production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will output a build folder with the compiled files.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach with React components organized into specific folders:

```

└── package.json                # npm configuration file
```

## Design Approach

The design approach focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive interface. The layout adjusts based on screen size using:

- **CSS Flexbox**: For flexible and robust layout structures.
- **Media Queries**: To adjust styles based on screen sizes and user preferences.
- **Responsive Units**: Such as `vmin`, `vw`, and `calc()` for font sizes and spacing.

## Challenges

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Issue**: Ensuring a consistent layout on various screen sizes.
   - **Solution**: Utilized Flexbox and media queries to dynamically adjust the layout.

2. **Asset Management**:
   - **Issue**: Correctly referencing images in the React project structure.
   - **Solution**: Used relative paths and tested the image paths in different components.

3. **Animation Preferences**:
   - **Issue**: Ensuring animations are accessible and do not cause motion sickness.
   - **Solution**: Implemented the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.

## Technologies Used

- React
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- React Icons for social media icons

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
